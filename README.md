# List Processing Program

## Description
This Java program processes two lists (`list1` of Integers and `list2` of Strings) to generate a result list by:
1. Creating `list3` from elements in `list2` selected using a pattern derived from `list1`
2. Removing every second element (elements at indices 0, 2, 4...) from `list3`

## Features
- Processes lists of any size
- Handles index out-of-bounds situations
- Preserves original lists (non-destructive operations)
- Clear console output showing each processing stage
